EcoMeter: Tracking Urban Footprints for Climate Resilience

###Overview
EcoMeter is an innovative application designed to assist urban dwellers in monitoring and reducing their resource consumption to mitigate climate change. The application features a main calculator that helps users track their resource usage over a week, visualize their progress through a graph, and receive weekly lifestyle recommendations. Additionally, EcoMeter fosters a community where users can interact, share their progress, and raise awareness about sustainable living.

###Project Background
The international scientific community has long acknowledged that human lifestyles, particularly in urban areas, significantly contribute to climate change. Cities, housing over half of the worldâ€™s population and being centers of economic activity, are major contributors to emissions and are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Urban centers are already experiencing these effects, prompting a global shift towards sustainable living to reduce environmental and climate damage.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, our team decided to contribute to climate change mitigation by developing EcoMeter. This project aims to help individuals become more aware of their resource consumption and adopt sustainable lifestyles.
